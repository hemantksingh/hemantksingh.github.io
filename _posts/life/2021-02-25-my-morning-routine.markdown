I've never been a morning person, but over a period of time I have trained myself to start my morning with a routine that helps me setup for the day. Now I must admit, not all my mornings are early but regardless of when I wake up I make it a point to start my day with this routine. The routine consists of guided meditation and reflection where I start off my day by reciting a few *mantras* and then remind myself of some of the teachings of [Guru Gopal Das](https://twitter.com/gaurgopald) and [Dandapani](https://twitter.com/DandapaniLLC) that have resonated with me. I am still a work in progress and in no way claim to have mastered all of their teachings but being reminded of them at the beginning of my day, everyday helps in the training of my mind.

- Life is finite, be the best version of yourself. Know yourself, know your goals, hold yourself accountable to your goals and strive to achieve your true potential.
  - Build extraordinary habits by performing small rituals that constantly remind you of your goals
  - Use affirmation - clear choice of concise words, clear visualization of success and corresponding feeling (feeling of success) to stay focussed
  - Starting new things is exciting but finishing what you started can be a long drawn out process during which it is very easy to lose interest and move on to something else.  Keeping your goals in mind, stay with a problem long enough to solve it. Keep your awareness on one thing for an extended amount of time, persevere and finish what you start. 
  - We are here for a limited amount of time, think about the future version of yourself, whether it'll be able to look back and say what an amazing life, I wouldn't have changed it for anything? In the future, you may or may not arrive where you initially set out to but did you arrive at a better place than you started and did you give it your best shot with absolutely everything that you had?

- Increase your standard of living
  - Life is finite, decide who you want to spend it with. Material gains are good for temporary pleasures, however focusing on your life and relationships provides you long lasting fulfillment and joy
  - Make a distinction between temporary joy and long term fulfillment and be consciously aware of that throughout your day so that you can focus on the essentials and stay away from distractions

- Go with the flow
  - Adapt and adjust to obstacles coming your way. Persevere, be flexible, be like the river *ganga* that finds its way to its destination inspite of all the hurdles that come its way
  - Rather than worrying about things outside your control, focus on the things you control & strive for excellence within your immediate area of impact (e.g. within your team)
  - Situations and circumstances are out of your control but how you respond to those situations is completely in your hands
  - See challenges as opportunities - *Thomas Edison*

- Don't live the life of "I"
  - Express gratitude - be grateful that you are safe, sound and alive. You are a tiny spec in this vast cosmos. Realizing that a number of forces - the environment and the people around you are working in tandem to keep you safe and sound allows you to be appreciative and be thankful.
  - Train yourself to think about others, think about serving, having a positive impact on others, think about what you can give rather than what you can extract from others
  - You will never face rejection when you want to give rather than take from others

- Find real peace
  - Learn to be comfortable while being uncomfortable
  - Your intellectual inclination can prevent you from doing mundane tasks, but if you remind yourself of your eventual goals, the mundane tasks can feel like steps towards achieving those goals.
  - In situations like conflicts be aware when your instinctive mind kicks in. Its natural tendency is to react (often with emotion) to keep you safe and secure and to keep you away from difficult & complex tasks (in your comfort zone). Call upon your sub conscious and super conscious mind in times of stress and difficulty.
  - Zoom out of stressful situations and focus on the intellectual mind (*sukshm buddhi*) rather than the instinctive mind (*sthool buddhi*). Remember all you are striving for is to get to a more joyful state, to be free (*mukt*) of sorrow, anxitey and fear so before getting into an argument or fighting over a position think whether it will lead you towards freedom (*mukti*)
