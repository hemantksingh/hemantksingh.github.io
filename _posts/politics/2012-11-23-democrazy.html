The time and effort we spend talking about the Indian democracy and how every Indian swears by it comes a cropper when events like what happened in Mumbai following Bal Thackeray's death occur.The recent arrest of two Mumbai girls for posting a comment on&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;is a case in point. The intolerance of our so called democracy is such that a reasonable opinion expressed in anguish results in a violent attack on your kin and you and your friend's arrest for the&nbsp;heinous&nbsp;crime of liking your Facebook post.<br /><br />Listening to some of the fledgeling accounts of providing justification of the arrest by the Shivsainiks was n't the least surprising. They adhere to the politics of force and violence. However what&nbsp;saddens me is to see the media discourse that has focussed on the moderation of thoughts. The idea of arresting the thoughts of &nbsp;people may find place in authoritarian societies like China but to fail to agree with the disruption caused by a divisive figure's funeral and express your distress publicly is a right provided in a free and liberal society and every individual ought to have the freedom to exercise that right.<br /><br />How could&nbsp;someone&nbsp;possibly&nbsp;violate this freedom in the name of respect and honour? If you need respect surely it gotta be earned and not demanded.<br /><br />A sad day in Indian democrazy..<br />A miffed citizen.
