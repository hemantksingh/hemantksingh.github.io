At 8pm on the 8th of November prime minister Narendra Modi announced that from midnight all 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee notes would cease to be legal tender. This deliberate shock demonetisation policy was announced with the following 3 main objectives:

* Removal of counterfeit currency
* Stamping out black money
* Move towards a cashless economy

This was a bold move as a surprise of this nature is meant to disrupt an economy in which 90% of all transactions are conducted in cash and the two cancelled notes account for 86% of all the currency in circulation. This was both economically and politically a risky move . The prime minister even had to make an emotional plea to the nation to back him and stick with the hardships caused by demonetisation for 50 days. In the past couple of weeks there has been a lot of anguish and distress amongst the general public with hours of queu'es outside banks and even [deaths](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/11/17/day-9-demonetisation-death-toll-rises-to-55/) being reported.

The media has called this a surgical strike on black money and corruption. Is this really a game changer that will get rid of the black money and corruption in India or are we paying too high a price for a supposedly elusive benefit? Let's begin by looking closely at the three objectives individually.

### Removal of counterfeit currency
**Benefit:** Funding for terror and other subversive activities in counterfeit currency will be removed.

*Does demonetisation achieve removal of counterfeit currency?* Yes! *Was this the only way of going about doing this?* No! A phased out release of new currency would have achieved the same objective without starting a panic that we are seeing today in the financial system. A lot of countries do this to improve security of the currency, all the time in a managed way. A shock to the system or the so called *surgical strike* wasn't necessarily required.

### Stamping out of black money
**Benefit:** Approximately $14 to $44 billion of back money will be extinguished.

According to the Ministry of Finance 2012 report, roughly 6 percent of the total black money is held in cash. Large proportions of black money is invested in real estate or gold and most of all moved abroad. Only a fraction of the funds received from illicit tax evading activities is kept in cash. Therefore the amount recovered due to demonetisation is a very small proportion. Even the 6 percent might not be completely coming back into the banks as people who hold that cash could and are laundering their black money by paying anywhere between 10 to 30%. Although the shock therapy prevents hoarders from diverting their money quickly but the target is too small to fetch or remove the entire $14 to $44 billion.

### Move towards a cashless economy
**Benefit:** Higher traceability of transactions, more businesses come under the tax net, higher revenues for government.

Did you imagine a *chaiwala* or a newspaper vendor getting paid via paytm? It is happening now, not because of choice but out of necessity. The shock therapy has definitely made people come up with innovative ideas to support their businesses as their livelihoods are at stake. This would not only widen tax collection as more transactions come under the tax net but prevent inaccurate invoicing by companies, under reporting of sales values and reporting non-existent transactions. However, this will take long and there will be a lot of pain in the interim especially in the rural economy until the new notes come into wider circulation. The two cancelled notes account for 86% of all the currency in circulation; over 90% of all transactions are conducted in cash, and over 85% of workers get their incomes in cash.

## What happens next?
So is all the pain worth going through? The honest answer is we don't know yet. A lot will depend on the follow up. There is little doubt about the sincerity of the move but the shoddy execution without thinking through the consequences has meant disruption to the market economy and causing severe hardships for the daily wagers and farmers. To think that a single surgical strike will end corruption and end black money would be naive. What is needed is major reforms in tax structure, real estate and political funding to remove the roots of corruption. Demonetisation is barely scratching the surface, if the follow up to it is a carpet bomb of reforms we may have a chance against corruption, otherwise *notebank* politics will continue.
