Hemant :) a techie based in Manchester, currently working in cybersecurity at [BeyondTrust](https://www.beyondtrust.com). Working in technology for over a decade I have learnt a few lessons that I try to share in this space. Be it provisioning infrastructure in the cloud, creating business critical applications or leading development teams to help them make better decisions, I care about how software is built. I believe in lean development, just enough design up-front and delivering effective software through Continuous Delivery.

I'm interested in infrastructure as code, application security and distributed system design. I also write and speak about designing, testing and securing software. Amidst rambling about stuff I also manage to write some code which is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hemantksingh) page. It has a bunch of things, from open source contributions to [what I am currently learning and experimenting](https://github.com/hemantksingh/messup-learn) with.

BeyondTrust is at the forefront of endpoint security, providing Privilege Access Management (PAM) solutions to help customers secure their assets. As a software architect, I am helping BeyondTrust's [Endpoint Privilege Management](https://www.beyondtrust.com/solutions) solution move to a cloud ready SaaS platform. Previously I lead [Kalibrate's](https://www.kalibrate.com) fuel retail pricing product move to a CI/CD delivery model by adopting microservices and cloud native applications. I have also delved into software consultancy at [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com) where I helped clients leverage technology to simplify their businesses. It meant helping the business model their domain, identifying service boundaries in a micro-services architecture, simplifying APIs to be RESTful, building CI/CD pipelines, running security threat modelling sessions, hassle people about sticking to the testing pyramid or just pairing with someone on a complex problem.

When not at work - cricket, cars, yoga and photography keep me occupied. Incidentally I also happen to have completely dispassionate opinions and views encompassing politics, history, Indian philosophy and cultural thought. Some of my musings can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_hemantksingh) and in this space too.
