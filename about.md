Hi I'm Hemant - a software engineer based in Manchester UK currently working at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/). Writing software for the past 8 years I have learnt a few lessons that I try to share in this space. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to build software the '*right*' way (if there is such a thing) and care about how it is built. Be it designing large scale databases or business critical applications, the opportunity of coming up with a software solution to a business problem and improving it over time is an absorbing exercise. I believe in lean development, just enough design up-front and delivering effective software through TDD.

I'm interested in functional programming, designing distributed systems and studying interaction mechanisms between distributed software components. I also write and speak about different ways of writing and testing software. Amidst rambling about stuff I also manage to do some work which is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hemantksingh) page. It has a list of random things from simple code [katas](https://github.com/hemantksingh/Katas) to spinning up [phoenix servers](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PhoenixServer.html) in the cloud.

As a consultant developer at Thoughtworks, I help clients leverage technology to simplify their businesses. On a given day it could mean helping the business model their domain, identifying service boundaries in a micro-services architecture, simplifying APIs to be RESTful, building Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery pipelines, running security threat modelling sessions, hassle people about sticking to the testing pyramid or just pairing with someone on a complex problem. I have also designed and led the development of [Advanced Legal's](http://advanced-legal.co.uk/) digital form production, document production and workflow management systems. Prior to this I worked at [Standard Life](http://standardlife.co.uk/), building complex insurance systems and business workflows for processing life and pension policies.

When not at work - cricket, squash, yoga and photography keep me occupied. Incidentally I also happen to have completely dispassionate and neutral opinions and views encompassing politics, history, Indian philosophy and cultural thought. Some of my musings can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_hemantksingh) and in this space too.
