Hemant :) a techie based in Manchester, currently working at [InfinityWorks](https://www.infinityworks.com/) - part of Accenture. Working in technology for over a decade I have learnt a few lessons that I try to share in this space. Be it securing infrastructure in the cloud, creating business critical applications or leading engineering teams to help them make better decisions, I care about how software is built. I believe in lean development, just enough design up-front and delivering effective software through Continuous Delivery.

I'm interested in cloud engineering, application security and distributed system design. I also write and speak about designing, testing and securing software. Amidst rambling about stuff I also manage to write some code which is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hemantksingh) page. It has a bunch of things, from open source contributions to [what I am currently learning and experimenting](https://github.com/hemantksingh/messup-learn) with.

Having worked with SAAS companies in product development and IT consultancies that drive digital transformation I have a broad experience in helping financial services, retail and public sector businesses leverage technology to improve operations and build new customer experiences in the cloud. As a Principal Consultant at Accenture, I help client executives make informed decisons about cloud migrations and lead engineering teams in software delivery. Previously, I led BeyondTrust's [Endpoint Privilege Management](https://www.beyondtrust.com/solutions) solution move to a cloud ready SaaS platform and [Kalibrate's](https://www.kalibrate.com) fuel retail pricing product move to a CI/CD delivery model by adopting microservices and cloud native applications. In a consultancy role at [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com) I worked on various digital transformation projects. It meant helping the business model their domain, identifying service boundaries in a micro-services architecture, simplifying APIs to be RESTful, building CI/CD pipelines, running security threat modelling sessions, hassle people about sticking to the testing pyramid or just pairing with someone on a complex problem.

When not at work - cricket, cars, yoga and photography keep me occupied. Incidentally I also happen to have completely dispassionate opinions and views encompassing politics, history, Indian philosophy and cultural thought. Some of my musings can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_hemantksingh) and in this space too.
