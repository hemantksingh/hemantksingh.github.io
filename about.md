Hemant :) a techie based in Manchester, currently working at [Kalibrate Technologies](https://www.kalibrate.com). Writing software for the past 9 years I have learnt a few lessons that I try to share in this space. Be it provisioning servers in the cloud or creating business critical applications, I care about how software is built. I believe in lean development, just enough design up-front and delivering effective software through Continuous Delivery (CD) and Test Driven Development (TDD).

I'm interested in functional programming, application security and distributed system design. I also write and speak about designing and testing software. Amidst rambling about stuff I also manage to do some work which is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hemantksingh) page. It has a list of random things, from simple code [katas](https://github.com/hemantksingh/Katas) to spinning up servers in the cloud.

As a solutions architect, I am helping [Kalibrate](https://www.kalibrate.com) move to a CI/CD delivery model by adopting microservices and a cloud ready self managed service platform. In the past I have worked at [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com) where as a software consultant I helped clients leverage technology to simplify their businesses. It meant helping the business model their domain, identifying service boundaries in a micro-services architecture, simplifying APIs to be RESTful, building CI/CD pipelines, running security threat modelling sessions, hassle people about sticking to the testing pyramid or just pairing with someone on a complex problem. Prior to this, at [One Advanced](https://www.oneadvanced.com/) I designed and led the development of their [legal form](https://www.oneadvanced.com/solutions/market-solutions/legal-forms/) production, document production and workflow management systems.

When not at work - cricket, cars, yoga and photography keep me occupied. Incidentally I also happen to have completely dispassionate opinions and views encompassing politics, history, Indian philosophy and cultural thought. Some of my musings can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_hemantksingh) and in this space too.
